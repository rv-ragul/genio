                            A technical quiz is a type of quiz that focuses on testing knowledge and understanding of technical subjects, such as science, technology and engineering fields. It may include questions related to concepts, theories and problem-solving techniques.
                            <br><br>
                            Technical quizzes may be used to assess the knowledge of students, professionals, or enthusiasts in a particular field, and may be conducted in various formats, such as online quizzes, written tests, or live competitions. The term technical quiz is a capacious one: it can refer to a single game consisting of just a few questions, or it can refer to a large-scale event involving dozens or hundreds of people.
