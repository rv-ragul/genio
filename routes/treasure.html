                                Even though this treasure chest filled with candy is a fun find for most kids, the real treasure is in the hunt!

                              From picture clues to word scrambles and anagrams, the kids enjoyed hours of fun during our latest treasure hunt. Now our lively youthful group varied in ages from 5-15 which worked great with the oldest helping the youngest. However, donâ€™t leave the fun just to the kids because my parents have lots of fond memories of adult treasure hunts which they called road rallies!
